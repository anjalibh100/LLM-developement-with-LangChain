# LLM-developement-with-LangChain
Large Language Models (LLMs) are the core component for LangChain. 

LangChain does not serve its own LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface for interacting with many different LLMs. 

There are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - the LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.

Langchain has interface for LLMs. LLMs Interfaces for language models use plain text as input and output.
